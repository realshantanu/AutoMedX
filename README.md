The Cardiovascular Disease Detection project is an ambitious initiative with the primary goal of developing a robust Machine Learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project focuses on accurately identifying and classifying four types of chest X-ray images: Pneumonia, COVID-19, Tuberculosis, and Normal cases. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, this project aims to assist healthcare professionals in achieving early and precise diagnoses, leading to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

Objectives
Develop a state-of-the-art Machine Learning model using CNNs for accurate classification of chest X-ray images.
Create a diverse and well-curated dataset of chest X-ray images containing cases of Pneumonia, COVID-19, Tuberculosis, and Normal lung patterns.
Employ data preprocessing techniques to normalize image intensities and ensure uniformity in resolution.
Train the CNN model with meticulous attention to hyperparameter tuning to maximize accuracy and minimize overfitting.
Evaluate the model's performance through rigorous testing and validation using various metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
Build an intuitive web or mobile interface to allow healthcare professionals to upload X-ray images and obtain predictions for disease detection.
Benefits
Early Detection: The advanced ML model facilitates early identification of cardiovascular diseases, including infectious conditions like COVID-19 and Pneumonia, leading to timely medical interventions.
Precision: By automating the classification process, the model reduces the chances of human error and subjectivity, ensuring precise and consistent results.
